## Features

### Headers
Headers 1-3 are neon green like above. Headers 4 and smaller headers are white.


### Code Blocks:
Code blocks have a light grey bubble around them. They use Rouge for syntax highlighting and look awesome. <br><br>
Here's some Python:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
And here's some HTML:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>This is lovely.</p>
```
### Links
Links are also neon green <a href="#links"> like this:</a>. They turn neon blue when hovered over or clicked.
